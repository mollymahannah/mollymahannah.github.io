 <h2>Harvey Perlman's lofty goals for UNL Enrollment</h2>
 <p>Harvey Perlman, Chancellor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, has set a goal to have 30,000 students enrolled at UNL by 2020. This goal has been
 mocked by several UNL students, including UNL's satirical publication The DailyER Nebraskan, because these goals seem near impossible for a school
 deemed the smallest in the big ten. After analyzing enrollment data provided by the UNL Office of Planning and Policy, it's clear to see that UNL's enrollment
has never been higher than 25,000 students. </p>

<p>In an effort to make UNL more appealing, Perlman also plans on getting more students to graduate in four years as opposed to five or six years.</p>
